# Character Creation App

***

## Premise:
This is a basic project to create a simple DnD character creation app that follows the creation guidelines as specified in the Players Handbook.

At the moment the idea is to have 3 levels of character creation:
 - Tier 1
 - Tier 2
 - Tier 3


### Tier 1.
Tier 1 will provide the most basic character: race, class and stats. 

Possible addition: the player is able to specify either a race or a class they wish to play, with the app configuring the character to fit the player spec.

### Tier 2.
Tier 2 will provide a bit more detail, such as suggested armor / weapons to use.

Possible addition: the player can specify a weapon to use with a class / race.

### Tier 3.
Tier 3 provides the most detail, possibly including a character name, maybe a spell list for spellcasters.


### Future Additions.
Add an API to the app so that it can be called from a website or something like Postman, returning a *json* format with the character details.
